Hi, my name is Charlie Alpert, and I am a computer science student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am expected to graduate in the class of 2025.

Currently, I am an outreach officer for the Artificial Intelligence Society at UTD where I organize the AIS hackathon, collaborate with other organizations, and connect with companies for events.
